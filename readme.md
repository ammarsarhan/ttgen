# üß† Automated Timetable Generator (CSP Project)

## üìò Overview

**Automated Timetable Generator** is a full-stack system that models timetable generation as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**.  
It dynamically generates valid university schedules using **Python (Flask)** for the backend and **Next.js + React Query** for the frontend.

This system can:
- Read timetable data (from Excel or a database)
- Automatically assign time slots, rooms, and instructors using a **CSP backtracking solver**
- Store generated timetables in a **PostgreSQL** database for history tracking
- Allow users to **view, update, and regenerate** timetables through a **modern Next.js dashboard**

---

## üß© System Architecture


- **Frontend**: Interactive UI for uploading data, generating timetables, and viewing history.
- **Backend**: Flask API implementing CSP solver logic, file parsing, and persistence.
- **Database**: Stores courses, instructors, rooms, sections, timeslots, and generated timetables.

## üéØ Features

### ‚úÖ Core Features
- Upload Excel/CSV file with department data
- Automatically generate a feasible timetable
- Store and retrieve previous generations (history)
- View, edit, and re-run generation with updated constraints

### üí° Advanced Features (Planned)
- Visual timetable UI
- Support for soft constraint optimization
- Integration with Google OR-Tools or genetic algorithms
- Authentication & role-based access

## üß† CSP Model

### Variables
Each variable = a lecture to schedule ‚Üí `(CourseID, SectionID)`

### Domains
Each variable‚Äôs possible values = combinations of:
- Available `timeslots`
- Suitable `rooms`
- Qualified `instructors`

### Hard Constraints
1. No instructor can teach two classes at the same time.
2. No room can host more than one class at the same time.
3. Room type must match course type (Lab/Lecture).
4. Each course section must meet its required weekly lectures.

### Soft Constraints (optional)
1. Avoid timetable gaps.
2. Avoid early morning or late evening slots.
3. Avoid consecutive distant classes for the same instructor.
4. Distribute lectures evenly across the week.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 (React 19, React Query, TailwindCSS) |
| Backend | Flask (Python 3.12) |
| Database | PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy ORM |
| CSP Engine | Custom Backtracking Solver |
| Deployment | Docker Compose |
| File Upload | Flask Uploads / REST API |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1- Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ammarsarhan/ttgen.git
cd ttgen

cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python seed.py   # Optional: seed sample data
flask run

cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2- Basic Usage
Once both the backend (API) and frontend (UI) servers are running:

üß± Backend (Flask API)

Runs on http://localhost:5000

Connects to PostgreSQL and stores:

- Courses, rooms, instructors, sections, and timeslots
- Generated timetables and history records

Handles all logic for:

- File uploads (Excel/CSV)
- CSP solving
- Timetable storage & retrieval

You can test API endpoints using Postman, cURL, or the frontend.

Example request to generate a timetable:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"semester": "Fall 2025/2026"}'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "timetable_id": 1,
  "summary": {
    "violations": 0,
    "generation_time": 1.27
  }
}
```

üíª Frontend (Next.js UI)

Runs on http://localhost:3000

Communicates with Flask through React Query API hooks

Provides:
1) Uploading ‚Äì upload Excel/CSV data files
2) Generating ‚Äì run the CSP solver and view results
3) History Tracking ‚Äì browse previously generated timetables
4) Timetable Page ‚Äì visualize detailed schedules

üß© Example Workflow

Upload Data

1) Click on upload
2) Upload an Excel or CSV file with courses, instructors, rooms, and sections
3) The backend parses and seeds the database

Generate Timetable

1) Click ‚ÄúGenerate Timetable‚Äù to trigger CSP solving on the backend
2) The backend applies constraints and assigns valid (time slot, room, instructor) tuples

View Results

1) Once generated, view the timetable grid or export as CSV
2) All generated timetables are stored with metadata (generation time, violations, etc.)

History

1) Visit /history or check the sidebar to view all past generations
2) Click any record to view its details and re-generate with adjustments

‚öôÔ∏è Developer Tips

To reset the database:

```bash
python seed.py 
```

To inspect tables in PostgreSQL:

```bash
psql -d csp -U <youruser>
\dt   # list tables
SELECT * FROM timetables LIMIT 5;
```

To debug the CSP logic:

Modify and test solver.py ‚Äî it‚Äôs modular and can run independently of Flask.
