# üß† Automated Timetable Generator (CSP Project)

## üìò Overview

**Automated Timetable Generator** is a full-stack system that models timetable generation as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**.  
It dynamically generates valid university schedules using **Python (Flask)** for the backend and **Next.js + React Query** for the frontend.

This system can:
- Read timetable data (from Excel or a database)
- Automatically assign time slots, rooms, and instructors using a **CSP backtracking solver**
- Store generated timetables in a **PostgreSQL** database for history tracking
- Allow users to **view, update, and regenerate** timetables through a **modern Next.js dashboard**

---

## üß© System Architecture


- **Frontend**: Interactive UI for uploading data, generating timetables, and viewing history.
- **Backend**: Flask API implementing CSP solver logic, file parsing, and persistence.
- **Database**: Stores courses, instructors, rooms, sections, timeslots, and generated timetables.

## üéØ Features

### ‚úÖ Core Features
- Upload Excel/CSV file with department data
- Automatically generate a feasible timetable
- Store and retrieve previous generations (history)
- View, edit, and re-run generation with updated constraints

### üí° Advanced Features (Planned)
- Visual timetable UI
- Support for soft constraint optimization
- Integration with Google OR-Tools or genetic algorithms
- Authentication & role-based access

## üß† CSP Model

### Variables
Each variable = a lecture to schedule ‚Üí `(CourseID, SectionID)`

### Domains
Each variable‚Äôs possible values = combinations of:
- Available `timeslots`
- Suitable `rooms`
- Qualified `instructors`

### Hard Constraints
1. No instructor can teach two classes at the same time.
2. No room can host more than one class at the same time.
3. Room type must match course type (Lab/Lecture).
4. Each course section must meet its required weekly lectures.

### Soft Constraints (optional)
1. Avoid timetable gaps.
2. Avoid early morning or late evening slots.
3. Avoid consecutive distant classes for the same instructor.
4. Distribute lectures evenly across the week.
